### [HelloWorld](./HelloWorld.cpp)
This program prints a simple message to the user.  
Output: 
```
Hello World
I haven't written in C++ in over a year

```
### [AmpsCalculation.cpp](./AmpsCalculation.cpp)
This program prompts the user for two double variables, thevoltage (V) and resistence (R) which will then calculate and display the current amps (I) and the power dissipation in watts (P).  
Output:
```
Enter the voltage: 120
Enter the resistance: 9.29
Given a voltage of: 120 and resistance of: 9.29
The amps are: 12.92
The power is: 1550.05
```
### [IfElseRand](./IfElseRand.cpp)
This program determines ticket price based on age by using a if... else if statements to check the user's age and what price they will pay.
